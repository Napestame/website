<h1>Trinity University</h1> 

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. It's a prestigous school that places a lot of value on rigor, liberal arts, experiential learning, and other ambitious values. It also balances strog support of modern innovation with the maintainence of old traditions. To get in, you neeed to excel in academics already and even then, a lot of the coursework will still be challenging. The university also favors majors in medicine and the sciences.</p>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="https://github.com/Napestame/website/blob/master/Trinity%20University.JPEG"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> Trinity has very large, expansive facilities. They're fairly well maintained for the most part 
and are usually pretty nice. My favorite builing is the Center for Sciences and Innovation building. Alongside the buildings, there's a vast network of staff assigned to provide resources or support to students. Outside, you'll likely find one a large population of cats. There might be 
some skunks too, just ignore them. All of the features I've covered so far are on upper campus. Below, down the stairs of "Heart Attack Hill", are a different athletic facilities, a football field, and Mabee Dining Hall, all of which are equally well maintained as the academic/staff buildings.   
Somehow, the school doesn't feel too suffocating as there are plenty of plants around, especially on upper campus, and there are some great views of campus as well. The dorm rooms may not look great, but their size and capacity for supplies makes them worth it.</p>
<p>The features I appreciate about Trinity the most are the helpful learning resources, kind staff, and rigorous academic requirements. The resources have helped me solve a lot of issues at campus. My favorite is the Student Learning Center in Coates Library because its a comfortable place to 
meet with tutors and study for classes. Secondly, all of the staff I've met have been very warm and encouraging while still eager to challenge students. It's very hard to hate the staff. If they weren't as accomodating, I probably would drop out. Meanwhile, the rigor of the courses here 
may be very overwhelming and crushing. I didn't like it, but in retrospect, I believe that it's made me a better student and helped me learn more in my classes.</p><br>

<p>I chose Trinity University for its focus on liberal arts, well supported chemistry program, and proximity to San Antonio. I'm a person with a lot of interests, often curious to explore other fields of study besides the ones I focus on at a whim. At Trinity, 
this behavior is requiered to fulfill your credits here, mmaking the school more ideal to me. Furthermore, connecting and working with students or staff in other major subjects is also supported. I think a feature like this is useful for opening the potential for students to make great connections
to other fields of study, inspiring more creativity and open-mindedness. I still prefer chemistry the best though. Here, the chemistry program fully encourages research and offers more advanced tools than a lot of other universities. I'm very adament about becoming a professional chemist and 
I hope to utilize these oppurtunities to better prepare for a career as a chemist. Finally, I think San Antonio is a amazing city with wonderful people and weather. I enjoy its atmosphere a lot outside of classes and wanted to attend to be near it more often. In conclusion, I joined to 
take advantage of the school's emphasis on liberal arts, its expansive chemistry program, and location by San Antonio.</p>
<p>I haven't decided on a major yet, but I'll likely pursue a degree in Biochemistry. This is because it involves knowledge in chemistry, a field I'm passionate about, and it's a quintessential degree to become an environmental chemist. These chemists are tasked with preserving and securing nature. 
I strongly value the nature we have, so I want to use my chemical expertise to protect it. Read the links below for more in-depth information on this subject:
